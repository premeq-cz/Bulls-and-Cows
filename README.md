Engeto - project 2

This i a simple guessing game. The code generates a random 4 digit number with unique digits. The user is to correctly guess the number. After each guess the code gives the user hints - how many digits are correctly guessed, and how many digits are correct but on a wrong position. The code keeps track of some simple statistical data - how much time it took the user, how many guesses. However it does not store this data externally.
